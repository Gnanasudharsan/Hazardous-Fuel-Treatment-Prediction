# Hazardous-Fuel-Treatment-Prediction
This project develops machine learning models to predict the number of acres treated in hazardous fuel reduction activities by the U.S. Forest Service. Using features such as treatment type, method, planning year, land suitability, and cost inputs, we built predictive models that achieve over 94% accuracy.
